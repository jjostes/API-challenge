# API-challenge
output_data:
Contains image files of Weather Variables vs. City Latitude scatterplots. Variables include: temperature, humidity, cloudiness & windspeed. 

WeatherPy:
Within the output cells of WeatherPy.ipynb are the above graphs, as well as scatterplots of Max Temp, Humidity, & Windspeed vs. City Latitude, respectively. The latter set of graphs were also split across the Northern/Southern Hemispheres, in all totalling an additional 6 maps to the original 4. 

VacationPy:
Contains exported images of heatmaps produced within the notebook. 

Overview:
Using randomly selected cities from across the globe, API calls were made to OpenWeatherMaps in order to collect weather data. These were then used to generate plots to see if these weather variables correlated with changes in latitude or longitude, some including linear regressions and r-squared values. A heatmap was then created to display humidity, as well as filtering for ideal hotels listed via the Google Places API.
